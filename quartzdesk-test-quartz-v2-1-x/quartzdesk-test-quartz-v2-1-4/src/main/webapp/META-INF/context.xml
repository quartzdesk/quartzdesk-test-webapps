    Exclude scanning of bootstrap classpath to avoid StackOverflowError during the classpath scanning performed
    by Tomcat's JAR scanner. This error seems to occur if there are duplicate JARs on the classpath. For example,
    JDBC driver JARs. Typically, there is a JDBC driver JAR on the QuartzDesk JVM Agent's classpath (bootclasspath)
    and there may be the same JDBC driver installed in Tomcat's shared lib folder.
